Career Transition Path Finder with Fixed Stages

This implementation modifies the original MST approach to provide exactly 4 stages
with 10 skills each, and calculates job coverage for each stage.

The main changes include:
1. New FixedStageMSTStrategy class - organizes skills into exactly 4 stages with 10 skills each
2. New FixedStageFrequencyStrategy class - similarly uses 4Ã—10 structure but based on frequency
3. Modified comparison function to calculate coverage metrics after each fixed stage
4. Updated visualization to show stage-by-stage job coverage comparison

                    **How this approach works:**

                    1. Each algorithm (MST-based and Frequency-based) identifies the 40 most important skills to learn
                    2. These skills are organized into exactly 4 stages with 10 skills per stage
                    3. The job coverage percentage shows how competitive you would be in the job market after each stage

                    **Key differences between algorithms:**

                    - **MST Fixed-Stage Strategy**: Uses graph theory to find skill "bridges" - skills that connect to others in an optimal pathway
                    - **Frequency Fixed-Stage Strategy**: Simply ranks skills by how often they appear in job postings

                    This approach makes it easy to compare both methods on an equal footing (same number of skills at each stage)
                    and helps you plan your learning in manageable phases.
